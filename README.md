# Tests for MPI Sessions extensions to the MPI API

To build these tests you will need the following package:

- MPI Sessions prototype

## Installing the prototype

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:hpc/ompi.git
cd ompi
git checkout sessions_new
./autogen.pl
./configure --prefix=my_sandbox 
make -j install
```

## Installing the tests

```
export PATH=my_sandbox/bin:$PATH
git clone  https://github.com/hppritcha/mpi_sessions_tests.git
cd mpi_sessions_tests
make
```

## Running the tests

Assuming the checkout of the prototype occurred after 6/26/20, the tests can
be run using either the ```mpirun``` installed as part of the build of the
prototype, or prte/prun can be used.

When using prte, the tests can be run as follows:

```
prte --daemonize
prun -n 4 ./sessions_ex2 mpi://world
prun -n 4 ./sessions_ex3
prun -n 4 ./sessions_ex4
prun -n 4 ./sessions_test
```

To run using mpirun:

```
mpirun -np 4 ./sessions_ex2 mpi://world
mpirun -np 4 ./sessions_ex3
mpirun -np 4 ./sessions_ex4
mpirun -np 4 ./sessions_test
```

This example assumes your system has at least 4 slots available for MPI processes.
Also, prte is a work in progress.  It may be best to kill the prte daemon after each
run and restart the prte daemon.

Note the third example may not have been built if you are using an old Fortran compiler 
that isn't able to generate the ```mpi_f08``` Fortran module.

## Special instructions for using prte/prun on a Cray XC and SLURM

On Cray XE/XC systems running SLURM, prte has to use a different procedure for launching
processes on the first node of a SLURM allocation.  Namely, prte launches a prte daemon
using the local slurmd daemon.  As a consequence, there are effectively two prte daemons
on the head node, the prte launched on the command line and a second launched via slurmd.

To avoid annoying things like loss of stdout/stdin from the processes launched on the head
node owing to having two prte daemons running on the node, additional arguments most be added to the prte and prun commands:

```
prte --daemonize --system-server
prun -n 4 --system-server-first (additional arguments)
```


# Old instructions

These instructions are applicable if you are working with a checkout
of the MPI Sessions prototype prior to 6/26/20.

To build these tests you will need the following several packages:

- most recent version of PMIx
- most recent version of prrte
- MPI Sessions prototype

## Installing PMIx

```
git clone git@github.com:pmix/pmix.git
cd pmix
./autogen.pl
./configure --prefix=my_sandbox --with-libevent
make -j install
```

## Installing prrte

```
git clone git@github.com:pmix/prrte.git
cd prrte
./autogen.pl
./configure --prefix=my_sandbox --with-libevent --with-pmix=my_sandbox
make -j install
```

## Installing the prototype

```
git clone git@github.com:hpc/ompi.git
cd ompi
git checkout sessions_new
./autogen.pl
./configure --prefix=my_sandbox --with-libevent --with-pmix=my_sandbox
make -j install
```

## Installing and running these tests

```
export PATH=my_sandbox/bin:$PATH
make
prte --daemonize
prun -n 4 ./sessions_ex2 mpi://world
prun -n 4 ./sessions_ex3
prun -n 4 ./sessions_ex4
prun -n 4 ./sessions_test
```
This example assumes your system has at least 4 slots available for MPI processes.
Also, prte is a work in progress.  It may be best to kill the prte daemon after each
run and restart the prte daemon.
